# User Service

The **User Service** is a microservice responsible for managing user-related functionalities within the application. It handles user registration, authentication, and profile management, ensuring secure access to the system.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account with necessary information such as name, email, and password.
- **Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access to protected resources.
- **Profile Management**: Enables users to view and update their profile information.
- **Role Management**: Supports different user roles (e.g., regular user, librarian, super admin) for managing access to various functionalities within the application.
## Database Setup

### Database Structure

We are using **PostgreSQL** as the primary database for this application. Below is an overview of the database schema, which includes the `users` table and an enum type for user roles.

#### Enum Type: `user_role`

We have defined a custom enum type `user_role` to represent the different roles available in the system:

- `user`: Standard user.
- `super admin`: Admin with full privileges.
- `librarian`: User responsible for managing books and library operations.

```sql
-- Create an enum type for roles
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('user', 'super admin', 'librarian');
```

#### Table: `users`

The `users` table stores information about the registered users of the application. Each user has a role defined by the `user_role` enum.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role user_role NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
