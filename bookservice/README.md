# Book Service

The **Book Service** is a microservice designed to manage the libraryâ€™s book inventory and borrowing activities. It facilitates interactions between users and the book database, allowing users to view, borrow, and return books.

## Key Features

- **Book Management**: Enables the addition, updating, and deletion of books in the library catalog.
- **Borrowing Records**: Tracks borrowing activities, including which user borrowed a book, the borrowing date, and due dates for returns.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, or category.

## Database Setup

### Database Structure

We are using **PostgreSQL** as the primary database for this application. Below is an overview of the database schema, which includes the `books` and `borrowing_records` tables.

#### Table: `books`

The `books` table stores information about the books available in the library. Each book has a unique ID and contains relevant metadata, such as title, author, and publication details.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

CREATE TABLE books (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(13),
    published_date DATE,
    category_id UUID,
    stock INT,
    added_by UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    version INT DEFAULT 0
);
```

| Column         | Data Type        | Description                                                           |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`           | UUID             | Primary key, a unique identifier for each book (auto-generated).      |
| `title`        | VARCHAR(255)      | The title of the book.                                               |
| `author`       | VARCHAR(255)      | The author of the book.                                              |
| `isbn`         | VARCHAR(13)      | The ISBN of the book (optional).                                     |
| `published_date`| DATE            | The date when the book was published (optional).                     |
| `category_id`  | UUID             | Foreign key referencing the category of the book (optional).         |
| `stock`        | INT              | The number of copies of the book available in the library.           |
| `added_by`     | UUID             | Foreign key, representing the user who added the book (optional).    |
| `created_at`   | TIMESTAMP        | The timestamp when the book was added (auto-generated).              |
| `updated_at`   | TIMESTAMP        | The timestamp when the book details were last updated (auto-generated).|
| `version`      | INT              | Versioning field, useful for optimistic concurrency control.         |

#### Table: `borrowing_record`
The `borrowing_records` table keeps track of all book borrowing activities. It records when a book was borrowed, who borrowed it, and when it is due for return.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

CREATE TABLE borrowing_records (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  book_id UUID REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID,
  borrowed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  due_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  returned_at TIMESTAMP
);

```
